The folder GEOSTAT_Grid_POP_2006_1K.7z contains the following files:
- the actual population data in csv format, GEOSTAT_Grid_POP_2006_1K.csv,
- an empty grid net, Grid_ETRS89_LAEA_1K_ref_GEOSTAT_POP_2006.shp, as a spatial reference grid to the gride cell codes used in GEOSTAT_Grid_POP_2006_1K.csv. The grid net was created according to the INSPIRE data specifications for European grids. The grid net Grid_ETRS89_LAEA_1K_ref_GEOSTAT_2006.shp only contains cells that are inhabited. Areas not covered by grid cells is therefore not inhabited by residential population for the reference year 2006.
- An INSPIRE metadata file in ISO19139 encoding, MD_GEOSTAT_Grid_POP_2006_1K.xml. The metadata file provides mainly information on the production process of the individual national datasets that were integrated into this European grid
- A file describing conditions for access and use of the population data, GEOSTAT_Grid_POP_2006_1K_Usage-and-License-Conditions.txt.

The final report including the manual for the creation of this grid dataset can be downloaded from the Eurostat website: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/gisco_Geographical_information_maps/publications/geostat_population_grid_report
